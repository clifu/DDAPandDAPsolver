# DDAPandDAPsolver

Simple .NET Core 3.0 console application to solve dimensioning and demand allocation problem OR demand allocation problem for OAST course on WUT. The course aims at presenting basic mathematical models and methods for computer networks optimization (e.g., for cost minimization) and performance analysis (e.g., for determination of traffic service quality measures), based on integer programming supported by metaheuristics (optimization), and on queueing theory and simulation (performance analysis).
